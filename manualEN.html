Defeat robot and raise AI girl intelligence!
Give her brain the item earned from defeating a wave such as modules and chips! 
Give enough and you will receive buff!

The board system in this game was inspired by noita.
You can freely customize your attack by combining parts.
If you connect bullet on the board together, they will fire in order 
and the cooldown for the one being connect will lower by the one connecting.
However if you have a closed loop, the bullet won't fire at all so be careful! (I was gonna make it explode but the animation is too much work)
