Defeat robot and raise AI girl intelligence!
Give her brain the item earned from defeating a wave such as modules and chips! 
Give enough and you will receive buff!
The intelligence point earned = number of that wave

The board system in this game was inspired by noita.
You can freely customize your attack by combining parts.
If you connect bullet on the board together, they will fire in order 
and the cooldown for the one being connect will lower by the one connecting.
However if you have a closed loop, the bullet won't fire at all so be careful! (I was gonna make it explode but the animation is too much work)

MAKE SURE TO PLAY IN FULLSCREEN!!!!

In this game you fight robot and raise the intelligence of an AI girl.
In between the wave of enemies, you can feed the girl chip and module you picked up into her brain on the head circuitboard.
Her intelligence will grow and she will gain buff. The intelligence point you gain is the number of the current wave.

The board system is inspired by noita.
You put part together to create your own attack.
If you connect projectile with another projectile, they will fire in order.
Beware of closed loop. Your board will not be able to fire if there is one. (I was gonna make it explode but it was too bothersome)
